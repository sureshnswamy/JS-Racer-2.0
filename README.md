# javascript-racer

This version is a completely different one from the prvious game built on simple table elemetn funtionality.

I got most of the ideas  from this https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-racer/

I previously used canvas to bulid a fun programe to generate random cicles http://sureshnswamy.github.io/random-circle/

With that preliminary working knowledge I wrote this code.

It is a single player game with keyboard control.
